100002|t|Value and limitations of the electrocardiographic response to exercise in the assessment of patients with coronary artery disease. Controversies in cardiology--II.
100002|a|The results of exercise testing provide a probabibity statement rather than a definitive answer regarding the existence of coronary disease. Moreover, in asymptomatic subjects (1) the S-T segment response to exercise testing has a relatively poor predictive accuracy, (2) exercise testing does not appear to be a practical screening method for detecting subjects at high risk of sudden death, and (3) risk factors should be vigorously treated regardless of the results of screening studies for coronary artery disease. Hence, the probability statements derived from the electrocardiographic response to exercise testing do not appear to provide important enough diagnostic or prognostic information to justify routine use in asymptomatic subjects. Although exercise screening studies provide only marginal aid in detection coronary artery disease in symptomatic patients, important prognostic information may be derived that could influence decisions regarding pharmacologic or surgical therapy. Thus, although electrocardiographic stress testing should not be used as a routine screening procedure, its judicious use in symptomatic patients may provide the physician with important information for patient management.

A case of group G streptococcal endocarditis is reported and the 11 cases reported previously are reviewed.

100013|t|Transplantation of pancreatic beta-cells prevents development of hypothalamic obesity in rats.
100013|a|The present experiments have tested the hypothesis that ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) lesions enhance insulin secretion by neural mechanisms. Rats were made diabetic by injecting streptozotocin to destroy their own pancreatic beta-cells. Subsequently, transplants of fetal pancreatic tissue were placed under the renal capsule. VMH lesions were placed in rats whose diabetes was cured with transplants as well as sham-transplanted animals. The animals were followed for 4 wk. The lesioned rats with pancreatic transplants gained no more weight than the sham-operated controls. There was no significant rise in insulin in the transplanted rats after VMH lesioning, but the VMH lesioned rats with intact pancreatic tissue showed the expected rise in insulin. Food intake rose 71% in the VMH lesioned rats with intact beta-cells, but only 23% in the VMH lesioned rats with transplants. Hypertrophy of the pancreatic islets was also observed in the VMH lesioned rats with an intact pancreas, but was not found in the VMH lesioned rats with a transplanted pancreas. Thus, transplantation of pancreatic tissue beneath the renal capsule of diabetic rats prevented the characteristic hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia, and obesity in VMH lesioned rats whose pancreas was free from intact innervation. The results support the hypothesis that neural mediation of the rise in insulin is the primary factor in the development of hypothalamic obesity.

100014|t|Regulation of glycogen resynthesis in muscles of rats following exercise.
100014|a|Following a strenuous bout of exercise, glycogen repletion occurred most rapidly in the fast-twitch red type of muscle, least rapidly in fast-twitch white, and at an intermediate rate in slow-twitch red muscle. There was a linear correlation between glycogen synthase I activity and the rate of glycogen synthesis in the three types of muscle. This finding helps explain the differences between the rates of glycogen resynthesis in the three muscle types, and supports the view that glycogen synthase activity is the most important factor determining the rate of glycogen synthesis when substrate supply is adequate. There was an inverse correlation between muscle glycogen concentration and percent glycogen synthase I. Plasma insulin concentration was low and norepinephrine and glucagon concentrations were elevated in the postexercise period. The finding that rapid glycogen synthesis occurred despite a hormonal milieu conducive to glycogenolysis provides evidence that a low glycogen concentration is a potent stimulus to glycogen synthesis that overrides the effects of low insulin, and high norepinephrine and glucagon levels.

100015|t|Circadian rhythm dissociation in an environment with conflicting temporal information.
100015|a|The relative contributions of light-dark (LD) cycles and feeding (EF) cycles in providing temporal information to the circadian time-keeping system were examined in chair-acclimatized squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus). The circadian rhythms of drinking, colonic temperature, urine volume, and urinary potassium excretion were measured with the LD and EF cycles providing either conflicting phases or periods. In conflicting phase experiments, animals were exposed to 24-h LD cycles consisting of 12 h of 600 lx followed by 12 h of less than 1 ls and concurrent 24-h EF cycles in which the animals ate for 3 h and then fasted for 21 h. One group had food available at the beginning and a second group at the end of the light period. In conflicting period experiments, monkeys were exposed to 23-h LD cycles (LD 11.5:11.5) and 24-h EF cycles (EF 3:21). Analysis of the rhythms showed that both phase and period information were conveyed to the drinking and urinary rhythms by the EF cycle, and to the temperature rhythm by the LD cycle.

27075942|t|Beh  et's disease: A comprehensive review with a focus on epidemiology, etiology and clinical features, and management of mucocutaneous lesions.
27075942|a|UNASSIGNED: Beh  et's disease (BD) is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory multisystem disease of unknown etiology. Oral ulcers, genital ulcers, cutaneous lesions, and ocular and articular involvement are the most frequent features of the disease. Mucocutaneous lesions are considered hallmarks of the disease, and often precede other manifestations. Therefore, their recognition may permit earlier diagnosis and treatment with beneficial results for prognosis. BD is particularly prevalent in "Silk Route" populations but has a global distribution. The disease usually starts around the third or fourth decade of life. Sex distribution is roughly equal. The diagnosis is based on clinical criteria, as there is no pathognomonic test. Genetic factors have been investigated extensively, and association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B51 is still known as the strongest genetic susceptibility factor. The T-helper 17 and interleukin (IL)-17 pathways are active, and play an important role, particularly in acute attacks of BD. Neutrophil activity is increased in BD, and the affected organs show a significant neutrophil and lymphocyte infiltration. HLA-B51 association and increased IL-17 response are thought to play a role in neutrophil activation. Treatment is mainly based on the suppression of inflammatory attacks of the disease using immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive agents. Although treatment has become much more effective in recent years with the introduction of newer drugs, BD is still associated with considerable morbidity and increased mortality. Male sex, younger age of onset and increased number of organs involved at the diagnosis are associated with a more severe disease and, therefore, require more aggressive treatment.
